## What did I do?
1. First, I initialised a new NPM package via `npm init` in the terminal. Next, I proceeded to install `create-react-app` through the command `npm install create-react-app`. I ran `npx create-react-app reactreduxtodolist`, which created the React application. Later, I modified the folder structure by test files, seperating container & functional components, & CSS styling into their own folders. I also HTML refactored code (by omitting comments) and deleted unneccessary files. 
2. The header was the first component I created & it consists of an image and text.
